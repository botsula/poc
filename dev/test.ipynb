      "\"SeedBlink, the co-investment platform for European startups, has established itself as a leader in the sector in Bulgaria, raising €2.69 million in its first year of operations. Since its European launch in 2019, the platform has amassed €150 million in startup investment, with over 200 key partners including Bulgarian Eleven Ventures, LAUNCHub Ventures, Silverline Capital, and Vitosha Venture Partners. Its community of investors now stands at over 67,500, with the largest portfolio value being over €500,000, and the average one at €17,500. \n",

      "CEE is showing its potential as a fast-growing region for venture capital funding in Europe, despite the recession, high inflation, and decrease in fundraising rounds. In 2021 and 2022, more than €100 billion have been invested in European tech startups, and 35% of that is focused more on social and environmental impact. 11 impact startups have become unicorns in 2022, with the majority of them being in the UK, France, Sweden, and Germany. \n",
      "\n",
      "In Bulgaria, Series C and Series D make up the majority of shares from the total funding, showing that local startups are growing and the ecosystem is maturing. There have been twice as many rounds in 2021 and 2022 compared to the previous years, despite the recession, and the number of rounds has constantly increased in the past three years. Payhawk and UiPath, two Bulgarian startups, have become unicorns this year and 2018 respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "SeedBlink has consolidated its infrastructure and expanded its presence in Central and Eastern Europe and Benelux to innovate on a European scale. It is now available for Bulgarian investors, with information and resources in Bulgarian. Horváth & Partners Management Consultants is also working with SeedBlink to bring more investors to the platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ivaylo Simov, Managing Partner at Eleven Ventures, said: “Bulgaria had a head start compared to other countries in the region because they dared to launch something earlier; the other reason is that we invested a lot in early-stage companies. This created a network effect in the upcoming years.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Max Gurvits, Partner at Vitosha Venture Partners, also commented: “I’m not originally from Bulgaria, but this is my home country right now. I was fortunate to be part of the local ecosystem from the beginning, and I could see people building it. Today, I’m amazed by how big it’s become.” \n",
      "\n",
      "SeedBlink is playing an important role in the Bulgarian economy, making it easier for Bulgarian investors to gain access to a class of assets that would otherwise be off-limits, namely private enterprises. It also provides a network of individuals ready to support the growth ambition of Bulgarian startups. \n",
      "\n",
      "Constantin Pelehra, Senior Project Manager at Horváth & Partners Management Consultants, said: “We believe SeedBlink offers a great product that allows retail investors to benefit from the value created by tech startups. These startups are at the forefront of innovation and can bring new technologies, business models, and approaches to the market. Given our competencies, we are in a strong position to help SeedBlink and its community of investors and we are looking forward to 2023.” \n",
      "\n",
      "SeedBlink has been a leader in venture capital funding in the CEE region and is continuing to grow, providing a platform for investors and startups to come together and create a thriving ecosystem. With the help of investors, it is on track to continue its success in the coming years and contribute to the public validation of the regional potential.\n",
